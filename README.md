This project was developed for the Hology Data Mining Competition, which focuses on strengthening analytical thinking, data mining proficiency, and the ability to design effective data-driven solutions.

The task centers on a multi-label classification problem, where a single data instance can belong to multiple categories simultaneously. Unlike traditional binary or multi-class classification, this approach requires modeling label dependencies and handling overlapping class assignments within the same dataset.

The objective of the project is to build a robust machine learning model capable of accurately predicting multiple labels per instance, while maintaining balanced performance across all label dimensions. The solution emphasizes proper preprocessing, feature engineering, and evaluation using multi-label metrics to ensure reliable and scalable predictive performance.
